# ReadyAPI TestEngine Maven Plugin

A maven plugin that runs a set of SoapUI/ReadyAPI projects with ReadyAPI TestEngine - 
configure it to run in whatever build phase you might find relevant, for example;

```
<plugin>
    <groupId>com.smartbear.readyapi</groupId>
    <artifactId>testengine-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.1</version>
    <configuration>
        <username>defaultUser</username>
        <password>defaultPassword</password>
        <server>...ReadyAPI TestEngine endpoint...</server>
    </configuration>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <id>run</id>
            <phase>integration-test</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>run</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

The only goal exposed by the plugin is "run" - you can invoke it as above or directly from the command-line, for example

```
mvn testengine:run 
```

The plugin will look for files with either json or xml extensions.

## Configuration

Configuration parameters are:

* username (required) : the TestEngine username to use for authentication
* password (required) : the TestEngine password to use for authentication
* server (required) : endpoint of the TestEngine (no trailing slash!)
* recipeDirectory : the folder to scan recursively for recipes/projects, defaults to ${project.basedir}/src/test/resources/recipes
* targetDirectory : the folder to which filtered recipes will be copied before executing, defaults
to ${project.basedir}/target/test-recipes
* properties : an optional set of additional properties that will be used during filtering (see below)
* disableFiltering : disables filtering of recipes - if set to true the recipes will not be copied and filtere
to the target directory, instead they will run directly from the source directory.
* reportTarget : the folder to which a junit-report.xml file will be generated (as can be processed by 
the surefire plugin), defaults to ${basedir}/target/surefire-reports
* environment : if you're submitting existing SoapUI/Ready!API project files this allows you to select which environment 
to target
* async : toggle if tests should be executed asynchronously - default is false which will wait for tests to finish 
 to be able to create test-reports. Setting this to true will disable reporting functionality, but allow you 
to specify an optional callback that will be called by the TestEngine with test results when they are finished.
* callback : an optional url to call with finished test results if async is set to true 

Specifying a skipApiTests system property will bypass this plugin altogether.

The plugin will also look for standard properties file named recipe.properties in the recipeDirectory folder and
load any properties in this file before applying the properties specified in the configuration.

## Filtering

Json recipes will be filtered and copied to the folder specified by targetDirectory before getting executed. 
Any available property will be replaced, which makes it easy to parameterize your tests.

For example the following simple recipe:

```
{
    "testSteps": [
        {
            "type": "REST Request",
            "method": "GET",
            "URI": "${apitest.host}/apis",
            "assertions": [
                {
                    "type": "Valid HTTP Status Codes",
                    "validStatusCodes": [200]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

would use a property defined as 

```
...
<apitest.host>...</apitest.host>
...
```              

when assembling the URI. You can simply look in the targetDirectory folder after your tests were run to see what was 
actually executed.

## Error reporting

Currently the plugin simple fails the build if any tests fail and dumps the ReadyAPI TestEngine 
response to the console. A surefire xml file is generated for inclusion in generated reports.

## Building the plugin

Simply pull this repo and run 

```
mvn clean install
```

to install the latest version of the plugin locally. It will eventually be made available on maven central also.


## Next steps?

Obviously huge list of things to improve:
- support datadriven tests
- improved surefire reports
- etc..
